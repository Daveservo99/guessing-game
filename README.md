# guessing-game
guess a number 1-100 and it tells you to go higher or lower
I am learning javascript. this is the first real thing I have made from scratch.  It creates a random number between 1-100 and then you guess.
It will tell you if you need to go higher or lower and prompt you for another guess.  It keeps track of how many guesses and tells you when you get it.
